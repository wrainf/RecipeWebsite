    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill for medium heat.</li>
        
        <li>In a shallow bowl, mix the mustard, honey, mayonnaise, and
             steak sauce. Set aside a small amount of the honey mustard 
             sauce for basting, and dip the chicken into the remaining sauce to coat.</li>
        
        <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken over indirect heat 
            for 18 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, or until juices

             the last 10 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning!</li>
