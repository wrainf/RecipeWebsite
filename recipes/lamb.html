    <p>Tender pieces of lamb, marinated in a Greek lemon vinaigrette, threaded on skewers and char-grilled to perfection. 
        I like to serve these with rosemary garlic roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and pita bread.</p>

        be your new go-to recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar/li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until all of the 
            lamb is coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, 
            basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
    </ol>
